# Project Title

This is a short project examinging the distance learning dataset located here (https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset).  In this project I am building a model to predict the final exam score for a student in the "DDD" module using their past grades, demographics, and study habits.  

## Getting Started

* You will need to move a copy of the distance learning data located here (https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) to the data/raw directory.  
* Then you will need to run src/data/features/preprocessing.py 
* You should be good to go, the only piece of code you wouldn need at that point is the StudentAnalysisAndModel.ipynb located in the notebooks directory 

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following packages to run the code

```
conda install scikit-learn
conda install pandas
conda install numpy
conda install matplotlib
```
